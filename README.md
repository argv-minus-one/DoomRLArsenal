# DoomRL Arsenal

This is my take on Yholl's excellent [DoomRL Arsenal](http://forum.zdoom.org/viewtopic.php?t=37044) mod for [ZDoom](http://zdoom.org/). This version has a PK3-style folder structure (Git doesn't understand how to merge WAD entries). I've also added some gameplay tweaks.

This will probably be rendered obsolete whenever DoomRL Arsenal 1.0 finally lands. Until then, though, there's this.
